Fontis Router Extension
=======================

This extension allows you to define your own routers without using Magento's
standard router. This is a utility extension which does not provide any
functionality on its own. It is intended to make it easier for developers to
create extensions for Magento with custom routing.

Further documentation is available from the [Fontis Router Extension](https://www.fontis.com.au/router-magento-extension)
page on our website.
